Description: CUSUM (CUmulative SUMmation) is a real-time monitor for CUmulative SUMmation of risk-adjusted survival outcomes. We provide O-E CUSUM and one-sided CUSUM plots. Users can tell the signal points indicating the center's performance is "better than expected" or "worse than expected" from the resulting plots.
